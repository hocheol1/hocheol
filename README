I. Set up
	1. Directories
	   *main* directory in this README: /home/jk237/for_seo/
	   /main/ed2/	: source codes (/src), installation codes (/build)
	   /main/eddata/: input data (meteorological, vegetation, soil, phenology)
	   /main/runs/  : This is where I (J.Kim) have putted all the runs together 
       /main/scripts/  : This is where I (J.Kim) have putted all the run-sh files together 
	2. ED2 installation
		@/main/ed2/build
		>./install.sh --clean
		>./install.sh --kind A --platform hec1
	3. copy ed_2.1-dbg and ed_2.1-dbg.a to a run_directory (eg. @/main/runs/run1 here)
	4. ED2IN file is to control the model run (required)
	   css and pss files are to set the vegetation initial status (not required to run from bare ground)
	   xml file is to set up the physiology of each pft, and also set up the hydrology 
      (if no xml file is provided, ED2 internal setting is putted)
	5. Directories to be checked are in /main/runs/run1/ED2IN, eddata/*_HEADER

II. Run
	1. @runs/run1
		>./ed_2.1-dbg
	2. Output files will be created in /main/runs/run1/Hist and /main/runs/run1/Anal
	3. To qsub the run, sh-script in /main/scripts/qsub_ed2.run1.sh
	   Job process log is writted in /main/runs/run1/ED2.log.date_time
